Title: Prediction using Linear Regression


The steps to create the relationship is -
• Carry out the experiment of gathering a sample of observed values
of height and corresponding weight.
• Create a relationship model using the lm() functions in R.
• Find the coefficients from the model created and create the
mathematical equation using these
• Get a summary of the relationship model to know the average error
in prediction. Also called residuals.
• To predict the weight of new persons, use the predict() function in R.

Methods used:

lm()
This function creates the relationship model between the predictor
and the response variable.

Syntax
The basic syntax for lm() in linear regression is:
lm(formula,data)

Following is the description of the parameters used :
• formula is a symbol presenting the relation between x and y.
• data is the vector on which the formula will be applied.

predict()
Syntax
The basic syntax for predict() in linear regression is :
predict(object, newdata)
Following is the description of the parameters used :
• object is the formula which is already created using the lm()
function.
• newdata is the vector containing the new value for the predictor
variable.

abline()
The R function abline() can be used to add vertical, horizontal or
regression lines to a graph.



//Input Data
> Height <- c(151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131)
> Weight <- c(63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48)

//Create Relationship Model using lm() & get the Coefficients
> relation <- lm(Weight~Height)

> print(relation)
Call:
lm(formula = Weight ~ Height)
